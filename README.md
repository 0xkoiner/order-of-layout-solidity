# Solidity 0xff #001: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Contract Layout 🚀

In my journey through Solidity, I keep noticing smart contracts that don’t stick to a consistent code layout. It’s not a critical issue since the compiler handles it anyway, but I believe Solidity’s suggested layout is about more than just aesthetics—it’s about creating a unified standard that helps all of us collaborate better.

<h2>💡 Why follow a layout?</h2>
A clean and consistent code layout:

Makes your contracts easier to read and maintain.
Helps new developers quickly understand the structure.
Sets a standard that aligns with the broader Solidity community.

<h2>Here’s the layout I recommend (simplified and user-friendly):</h2>
<br></br>
<details>
```
    Layout of Contract:
    version
    imports
    errors
    interfaces, libraries, contracts
    Type declarations (Enum, Struct)
    State variables
    Events
    Modifiers
    Functions

    Layout of Functions:
    constructor
    receive function (if exists)
    fallback function (if exists)
    external
    public
    internal
    private
    internal & private view & pure functions
    external & public view & pure functions
```</details>

It’s okay if you haven’t followed this structure before—consider it a new best practice to adopt! I’ll be sharing examples (with screenshots) and a ready-to-use template on GitHub to make it easier for you to start implementing this in your projects. 🛠️

Let’s embrace a shared standard and build better smart contracts together.
