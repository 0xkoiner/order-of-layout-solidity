# Solidity 0xff #001: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Contract Layout 🚀

In my journey through Solidity, I’ve noticed many smart contracts that don’t adhere to a consistent code layout. While this isn’t critical from a compiler’s perspective, I believe Solidity’s suggested layout isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about creating a unified standard that helps us collaborate better as a community.

## 💡 Why Follow a Layout?

A clean and consistent code layout:

- Makes your contracts easier to read and maintain.
- Helps new developers quickly understand the structure.
- Sets a standard that aligns with the broader Solidity community.

## Recommended Layout (Simplified and User-Friendly):

```
Layout of Contract:

Version
Imports
Errors
Interfaces, Libraries, Contracts
Type Declarations (Enum, Struct)
State Variables
Events
Modifiers
Functions
Layout of Functions:

Constructor
Receive function (if exists)
Fallback function (if exists)
External functions
Public functions
Internal functions
Private functions
Internal & Private view/pure functions
External & Public view/pure functions
```
It’s okay if you haven’t followed this structure before—consider it a new best practice to adopt! You can use with `OrderOfLayout.sol` ready-to-use template on GitHub to help you implement this in your projects. 🛠️

## 👉 Stay Tuned for Code Samples!

Let’s embrace a shared standard and build better smart contracts together.
